# Isaalo (aka Western Sisaala) Grammar

Glottocode: [west2465](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/west2465)

I conducted onsite fieldwork in Lambussie, Ghana, in 2004. This fieldwork resulted in my MA thesis, *A grammatical sketch of Isaalo (Western Sisaala)*, to be cited as:

```
@mastersthesis{Moran2006,
	Author = {Moran, Steven},
	School = {Eastern Michigan University},
	Title = {A Grammatical Sketch of {Western Sisaala}},
	Url = {http://commons.emich.edu/theses/73/},
	Year = {2006}}
```

It is also available online here: [http://commons.emich.edu/theses/73/](http://commons.emich.edu/theses/73/).

Afterwards, I began work (in progress) on a more detailed grammar. This is available in this repository in the pdf `ssl_moran2009.pdf`.

I also plan to make the data available in this repository in the future, once I've gotten it out of some legacy software formats.
